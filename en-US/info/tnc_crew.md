# RFQ (Request For Quotation)

##  How to send a RFQ (Request For Quotation)?

MOL’s RFQ (Request For Quotation) had been designed to satisfy the Buyers (primarily Shipowners) maritime business operations, improve efficiency and productivity. The RFQ is a high-end request for quotation service which as a buyer, you will only need to fill up a simple request form specifying your requirements. MOL will send your RFQ automatically to the group of Suppliers whom match your requirements. You will be able to receive multiple quotations to compare the prices, payment methods/ terms and shortlist your supplier to complete the transaction. To make use of the RFQ Function, you may go to MOL’s homepage, under Marine Online’s logo > Click “Place an order” > Select the Platform to send the RFQ. Alternatively, you may go to the individual platform’s homepage by clicking “Send Enquiry/ Send RFQ/ Get a Quote/ Send Purchase Enquiry/ Add Cargo” (For Chartering platform only) to send the RFQ.


##  My RFQ (Request For Quotation) will be send to who? Can I choose to send to a particular supplier?

Your RFQ (Request For Quotation) will automatically filter out the matching Suppliers based on the service category and port/ location. You may click the “RFQ Open Range” in the RFQ form to view all the matched Suppliers; you may select or unselect the Supplier(s) from the list and click Submit before sending your RFQ.

##  What kind of information do I need to provide in the RFQ?

To simplify the RFQ’s form, MOL only retain the necessary information to ensure that the Suppliers will be able to provide the quotation accurately based on the information you provided.

Please provide the RFQ information as specific as possible. You can enter the information by manual entry based on the individual platforms or by upload file using the Attachments function in the RFQ form.

##  How to set the RFQ Validity/ Cargo Expiry Date?

**RFQ Validity Date:**

It can be set under the RFQ Validity section in the RFQ form. There are two options:

-	Enter “days”, “hours” and “minutes”
-	Others, select calendar date and time

**Cargo Expiry Date: (For Chartering platform only)**

It can be set under the Cargo Expiry section in the Add Cargo form. There are six options:

-	Others, manual enter the expiry time

##  What is the payment method of the RFQ?

As a buyer (Shipowner), you can manually enter your payment requirement or expectation in the RFQ form, so the Suppliers will be able to know your requirement and decide if they can support your requirement in their quotation. This can be one of the considering factors before you select the Supplier.

##  Can I hide my company information in the RFQ?

You will be able to hide your company information in the RFQ by tick on the option, “Hide Information” under Company Information section. However, hiding your company information may cause you to receive lesser quotations.

You will be able to manage your RFQ under Order Management after you had sent it to the Suppliers.
